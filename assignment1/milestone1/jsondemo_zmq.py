#  Purpose: demonstrate serialization of a user-defined data structure using
#  JSON combined with ZeroMQ's REQ-REP sample code. Note that here we
#  are more interested in how a serialized packet gets sent over the network
#  and retrieved. To that end, we really don't care even if the client and
#  server were both on the same machine or remote to each other. Thus,
#  to simplify coding, we have mixed both the client and server in the same
#  code so that they run on the same machine. Hence, we term this as a Peer
#  which can don both roles.  When writing code for distributed client and
#  server, just separate the two pieces.
#
#  Here our custom message format comprises a sequence number, a timestamp, a name,
#  and a data buffer of several uint32 numbers (whose value is not relevant to us) 

# The different packages we need in this Python driver code
import os
import sys
import time  # needed for timing measurements and sleep

import random  # random number generator
import argparse  # argument parser

import zmq   # for ZeroMQ

## the following are our files
from custom_msg import CustomMessage  # our custom message in native format
import serialize as sz  # this is from the file serialize.py in the same directory
